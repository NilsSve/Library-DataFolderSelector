The Data Folder Selector Utility

The Data Folder Selector Utility helps users select a Data folder (Client Company) to use when a program starts.
Two parts are needed for this to work;

1. The SetupDataFolder.exe administrator program where Data folders are added, which later can be selected by end-users.
2. The DataFolderSelector.dg dialog. The file should be added to your program's Client_Area and will popup automatically when the program starts. The user can there select which Data folder/Company to use.
